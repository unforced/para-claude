# /process-daily - Interactive daily note processing

Thoughtfully review your daily note with AI assistance, discovering patterns and connections with your consent before making any changes.

## Usage
```
/process-daily [--date "YYYY-MM-DD"] [--skip-processed] [--update-daily-links]
```

Options:
- Without arguments: Processes the oldest unprocessed daily note (typically yesterday's)
- `--date`: Processes a specific date (even if already processed)
- `--skip-processed`: Only shows unprocessed notes
- `--update-daily-links`: Add wiki-links in daily notes (off by default)

**Default behavior**: Finds the oldest unprocessed note, which is usually yesterday's note after you've finished your daily writing

## Philosophy
- **Consent-based** - Nothing happens without your agreement
- **Interactive** - Conversational discovery, not automation
- **Intelligent** - Recognizes patterns and suggests connections
- **Respectful** - Your notes remain yours until you choose to organize
- **Temporal awareness** - Understands when things happened, not just when processed

## Interactive Process:

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Reads your daily note
   - Identifies patterns and connections
   - Finds potential updates
   - Discovers emerging themes

2. **Conversation Phase**
   - Shows findings one at a time
   - Asks clarifying questions
   - Confirms interpretations
   - Waits for your input

3. **Action Phase**
   - Only proceeds with consent
   - Shows exactly what will happen
   - Makes approved changes
   - Preserves original context

## Processing Log

The command maintains a log at `.para-claude/processing-log.md` tracking:
- Which daily notes have been processed
- When they were processed
- What actions were taken

This enables:
- Smart defaults (process oldest unprocessed)
- Avoiding duplicate processing
- Catching up on backlog
- Understanding your processing patterns

## Interactive Example with Unified Creation Flow:

```
You: /process-daily

Claude: I found 3 unprocessed daily notes. Let me start with the oldest:

üìÖ **Processing: Daily/2025-01-28** (3 days ago)

I'll review this note and help you process it thoughtfully.

[Reads note and finds patterns]

I noticed a few interesting things:

üéØ **Potential New Project: Podcast**
You wrote: "thinking about starting that podcast" - this is the 3rd time this month!

Let me extract what you've shared about this:
- "Want to interview interesting builders in Boulder"
- "John offered to help with audio equipment setup"
- "Could tie into Boulder.Earth community efforts"
- Previous mentions on Jan 15th and Jan 22nd

This seems like a project that's ready to emerge. Let me help you set it up thoughtfully.

What draws you to starting a podcast?
1. üé® Creative expression - stories demanding to be told
2. üèóÔ∏è Community building - strengthening connections
3. üìö Knowledge sharing - teaching what you've learned
4. üíº Professional growth - building authority
5. üåç Other: ___

You: 2 and 3

Claude: Excellent! Community building and knowledge sharing - that's powerful.

I noticed John offered to help with audio equipment. Should I link him as a collaborator?
And this could support your [[Areas/Boulder.Earth]] work, right?

You: Yes to both

Claude: What rhythm would work for you?
1. Weekly episodes (consistent schedule)
2. Bi-weekly (more production time)
3. Monthly deep-dives (quality over quantity)
4. Season-based (focused bursts)

You: 2

Claude: Perfect! I'll create [[Projects/Launch Podcast]] with:
- Community building + knowledge sharing focus
- [[People/John]] as collaborator
- Supporting [[Areas/Boulder.Earth]]
- Bi-weekly rhythm
- High energy (mentioned 3 times!)

I'll also:
- Copy your full podcast thoughts to the project folder
- Add backlink to [[Daily/2025-01-28#podcast-idea]]
- Create initial milestones based on your vision

Ready?

You: Yes

Claude: ‚úì Created [[Projects/Launch Podcast]] with rich context
‚úì Copied full thoughts to `Projects/Launch Podcast/Daily Thoughts/2025-01-28.md`
‚úì Added bidirectional links
‚úì Set up initial structure with your preferences

I also found:

üí´ **Person Update**
"Coffee with Mom - she seemed worried about her garden"

Should I log this interaction with Mom?

You: Yes, and remind me to follow up about the garden

Claude: Done! Added to [[Persons/Mom]]:
- Coffee chat - garden worries
- Follow-up reminder added

üèõÔ∏è **Area Observation**
You mentioned feeling "more energetic after morning walks" 

Add this positive note to [[Areas/Health]]?

You: Yes

Claude: ‚úì Completed Actions:
- Created [[Projects/Launch Podcast]] with John as supporter
- Updated [[Persons/Mom]] with interaction and follow-up
- Added morning walk benefits to [[Areas/Health]]

I found one more thing I'm unsure about:
"Really stuck on the presentation for next week"

This could be:
- A task for an existing work project
- Anxiety that belongs in a daily reflection
- Something else?

What would you like to do with this?

You: Just a reflection, leave it

Claude: Understood, leaving that as a personal reflection.

‚úÖ **Daily/2025-01-28 processed!**

I've logged this processing session. You have 2 more unprocessed notes:
- Daily/2025-01-29 (2 days ago)
- Daily/2025-01-30 (yesterday)

Would you like to:
1. Continue with the next note (2025-01-29)
2. Take a break and process later
3. See a summary of what we just processed

You: 2

Claude: No problem! I've saved your progress. 

When you're ready to continue, just run `/process-daily` again and I'll pick up with Daily/2025-01-29.

Have a great day!

## Pattern Recognition:

### People Patterns
- Names in context ‚Üí Suggests person tracking
- "Met with", "called", "coffee with" ‚Üí Interaction signals
- Repeated names ‚Üí Stronger person signal

### Project Patterns  
- Repeated topics ‚Üí Emerging project
- Research/planning language ‚Üí Active interest
- "Want to", "thinking about" ‚Üí Potential project

### Area Patterns
- Health observations ‚Üí Health area
- Home mentions ‚Üí Home area
- Work reflections ‚Üí Career area

### Smart Context
- Links existing entities
- Remembers name variations
- Learns your patterns
- Suggests connections

## What It DOESN'T Do:

‚ùå **No Automatic Processing**
- Never creates without asking
- Never assumes interpretation
- Never moves content

‚ùå **No Report Dumping**
- No long reports in your daily note
- Conversations happen in the moment
- Changes are made to appropriate files

‚ùå **No Lost Context**
- Original note stays intact
- All changes maintain backlinks
- Nothing gets "processed away"

## Unified Creation Flow:

When discovering potential new entities, we invoke the full conversational flow of the relevant command rather than simple yes/no prompts.

### Context Extraction First
Before asking any questions, extract all relevant context:
- Previous mentions of the topic across the vault
- People mentioned in connection with it
- Related areas or projects
- Emotional tone and energy level
- Specific details (tools, timelines, goals)

### Embedded Command Invocation
For each entity type, invoke its creation flow:
- **Projects**: Use `/new-project` flow with extracted context
- **People**: Use `/new-person` flow with relationship context  
- **Areas**: Use `/new-area` flow with responsibility patterns
- **Resources**: Use `/new-resource` flow with usage context

### Full Thought Preservation
Always preserve complete context:
1. Copy entire relevant sections (not summaries)
2. Create `Daily Thoughts/` folders in projects
3. Add temporal backlinks to specific sections
4. Maintain original formatting and context

## Conversation Flow:

### For New Entities (Enhanced)
```
"I noticed [pattern with context]. Let me extract what you've shared..."
‚Üí Show extracted context from daily note
‚Üí Invoke full creation flow with smart defaults
‚Üí Preserve complete thoughts in new structure
‚Üí Create bidirectional links
```

### For Updates
```
"I found [information] about [existing entity]. Should I add this?"
‚Üí Show exactly what will be added
‚Üí Confirm accuracy
‚Üí Update with permission
```

### For Ambiguous Items
```
"I'm not sure what to do with [item]. Could you help me understand?"
‚Üí Provide options
‚Üí Learn from response
‚Üí Act accordingly
```

## Learning System:

The command remembers:
- Name mappings (Bob ‚Üí Robert)
- Common contexts (coffee = meeting)
- Your patterns (weekly mom calls)
- Project interests (mentioned topics)

## Privacy & Respect:

- Only processes what you approve
- Asks before creating persons
- Preserves personal reflections
- Maintains thought privacy

## Examples:

```
/process-daily
```
Process today's note interactively

```
/process-daily --date "2025-01-27"
```
Process a specific date's note

## Processing Log Format:

Maintained at `.para-claude/processing-log.md`:
```markdown
# Para-Claude Processing Log

## 2025-01-31
- **Processed**: Daily/2025-01-28
- **Actions**: Created 1 project, updated 2 persons, noted 1 area observation
- **Skipped**: 1 personal reflection

## 2025-01-30
- **Processed**: Daily/2025-01-27

- Read note and analyze patterns
- Present findings conversationally
- One decision at a time
- Clear about what will happen
- Execute only with consent
- Learn from user choices
- No reports in daily notes
- Maintain conversational flow
- Update processing log after completion
- Allow breaking and resuming later
