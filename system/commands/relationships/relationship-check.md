# /relationship-check - Review relationship health

Analyze your relationships to identify who might need attention, celebrating strong connections and flagging those that may be drifting.

## Usage
```
/relationship-check [--days 30] [--tag "tag-name"] [--context "context-name"]
```

## What this command does:

1. **Scans all relationships** for interaction patterns
2. **Identifies relationships needing attention** based on usual patterns
3. **Highlights important dates** coming up
4. **Suggests reconnection actions**
5. **Celebrates healthy relationships**

## Philosophy
- **Intentional connection** - Use data to be a better friend
- **Pattern awareness** - Notice changes in interaction frequency
