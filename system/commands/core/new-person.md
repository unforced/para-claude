# /new-person - Begin tracking a meaningful connection

Interactively create a person file to intentionally cultivate connections with people.

## Usage
```
/new-person "Person Name"
```

## Interactive Process:

1. **Understands the connection** through conversational questions
2. **Explores shared contexts** without forcing categories
3. **Suggests relevant tags** based on your answers
4. **Creates rich frontmatter** for organization
5. **Sets up for natural growth** through interactions

## Philosophy
- **People as infrastructure** - Track connections like projects
- **Flexible, not categorical** - Use tags that fit your life
- **Context over categories** - How you connect matters more than labels
- **Privacy first** - Only track what helps you be present

## Questions Asked:

### Connection Context
- How do you know this person?
- What contexts do you share?
- What brought you together?

### Interaction Patterns
- How do you usually connect?
- What rhythm feels right?
- What helps you stay in touch?

### Shared Ground
- What interests do you share?
- Which projects might involve them?
- What areas connect you?

## Tag Suggestions Based on Context:

The command suggests natural tags based on how you describe the person:

### Professional Contexts
- "colleague" ‚Üí #person/colleague #context/work
- "mentor" ‚Üí #person/mentor #growth/professional
- "client" ‚Üí #person/client #context/business
- "collaborator" ‚Üí #person/collaborator #context/projects

### Personal Contexts  
- "friend from hobby" ‚Üí #person/friend #context/[hobby]
- "neighbor" ‚Üí #person/neighbor #context/community
- "gym buddy" ‚Üí #person/friend #context/fitness
- "book club" ‚Üí #person/friend #context/reading

### Growth Contexts
- "accountability partner" ‚Üí #person/growth-partner
- "study buddy" ‚Üí #person/learning-partner
- "creative collaborator" ‚Üí #person/collaborator #context/creative

### Multi-Context (most realistic)
- "Friend who became business partner" ‚Üí Multiple relevant tags
- "Colleague who shares hobbies" ‚Üí Both work and personal tags
- "Mentor who became friend" ‚Üí Evolution captured in tags

## Interaction Patterns:

After meetings/calls, update the person:
```markdown
## Interactions
- [[Daily/2025-01-28]] - Coffee chat, discussed her new design role
- [[Daily/2025-01-15]] - Helped with portfolio review
- [[Daily/2024-12-20]] - Holiday party at her place
```

## Growth Pattern:

**Week 1**: Just name and how you met
**Month 1**: Added birthday, key interests
**Month 6**: Rich interaction history
**Year 1**: Deep understanding of connection patterns

When complex ‚Üí `/expand "Persons/Sarah Chen"` for:
- Separate interaction log
- Shared projects tracking
- Gift ideas list
- Professional collaboration notes

## Privacy Guidelines:

‚úÖ DO Track:
- How you met
- Shared interests
- Important dates
- Your interactions
- What you discussed
- Commitments made

‚ùå DON'T Track:
- Private information they haven't shared openly
- Gossip or judgments
- Information that would embarrass if seen
- Anything you wouldn't want tracked about you

## Implementation Notes:

- Check if person already exists
- Support variations of names (nicknames, formal names)
- Add to daily note: "Created person: [[Persons/Person Name]]"
- Consider prompting for birthday/important dates
- Tag appropriately for person reviews
- Maybe suggest adding to relevant Area (e.g., "Family" area)
