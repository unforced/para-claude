[Continues with /process-daily flow...]
```

## Contextual Variations:

### First Time User
```
Welcome to Para-Claude! 🎉

I notice this is your first time using the system. Would you like me to:
1. Give you a quick tour
2. Help you create your first project
3. Show you how daily processing works
4. Explain the PARA method

What sounds most helpful?
```

### Returning User with Backlog
```
Welcome back! I see you have 7 unprocessed daily notes.

Would you like to:
1. Process just yesterday's note
2. Catch up on the full backlog
3. See a summary of what you've missed
4. Jump into something specific

No pressure - we can go at your pace!
```

### Active User
```
Good to see you! Here's what's happening:

🔥 **Active Work:**
- "Website Redesign" project due in 5 days
- "Health" area - weekly review due tomorrow
- Last talked to Sarah 3 days ago

What's on your mind today?
```

## Quick Actions Offered:

Based on context, suggests relevant commands:
- `/process-daily` - When you have unprocessed notes
- `/process-backlog` - When multiple notes are waiting
- `/weekly-review` - When it's been a week
- `/new-project` - When you mention something new
- `/new-area` - When no areas exist yet

## Learning Mode:

For new users or when requested:
```
You: I'm not sure how this works

Claude: No worries! Let me explain the basics:

**Your PARA System:**
- **Projects** = Things with deadlines (like "Learn Spanish by December")
- **Areas** = Ongoing parts of life (like "Health" or "Finances")  
- **Resources** = Stuff you might need (articles, tools, guides)
- **Archives** = Completed/inactive items
- **People** = Important relationships

**Daily Flow:**
1. Write naturally in your daily notes
2. Process them later to extract structure
3. Everything connects automatically

Want to try creating your first item? Or should I explain more?
```

## Status Checks:

Shows relevant system health:
- Processing streak/gaps
- Stale projects needing attention
- Areas due for review
- Recent people interactions
- Overall organization level

## Personality:

The /start command should feel like:
- A helpful friend greeting you
- Not overwhelming with information
- Encouraging but not pushy
- Adaptive to your energy level
- Ready to follow your lead

## Integration:

- Works well before any other command
- Can chain into other commands naturally
- Remembers context through the session
- Celebrates small wins

## Examples for Different Times:

### Morning
"Good morning! Ready to process yesterday's thoughts?"

### Evening  
"Evening! Want to review today or plan tomorrow?"

### Weekend
"Happy Saturday! Perfect time for a weekly review?"

### After Break
"Welcome back! I've kept everything safe while you were away."

## Remember:

This command sets the tone for the entire session. It should make users feel welcomed, oriented, and gently guided - never overwhelmed or pressured. The goal is to make starting feel natural and pleasant.
