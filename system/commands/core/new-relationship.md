# /new-relationship - Begin tracking a meaningful connection

Interactively create a relationship file to intentionally cultivate connections with people.

## Usage
```
/new-relationship "Person Name"
```

## Interactive Process:

2. **Explores shared contexts** without forcing categories
3. **Suggests relevant tags** based on your answers

## Philosophy

## Interaction Patterns:

After meetings/calls, update the relationship:

```

## Growth Pattern:

**Year 1**: Deep understanding of connection patterns

When complex ‚Üí `/expand "Relationships/Sarah Chen"` for:

- Consider prompting for birthday/important dates
- Tag appropriately for relationship reviews
- Maybe suggest adding to relevant Area (e.g., "Family" area)
