## Design Philosophy:

### Start with Why
- Motivation drives structure
- Values inform success metrics
- Purpose shapes practice

### Connect Everything
- Link to supporting arenas
- Connect with people
- Reference related pursuits

### Honor Your Style
- Daily practice vs. sprints
- Solo vs. collaborative
- Process vs. outcome focus

### Grow Naturally

- Add structure as patterns emerge
- Use `/expand` when ready

## Implementation Notes:

- Ask questions one at a time, conversationally
- Customize README based on all answers
- Create arena if mentioned and doesn't exist
- Link to relationships if mentioned
- Add creation note: "Started pursuit: [[Pursuits/Name]] - [why]"
- Generate initial energy/excitement in first log entry
- Suggest CLAUDE.md for pursuits needing AI support
- Keep the interaction energizing, not overwhelming
