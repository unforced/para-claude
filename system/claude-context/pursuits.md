# Working with Pursuits

Pursuits are meaningful quests with outcomes - more intentional than projects. This is a space for thinking about what you want to achieve.

## Your Role in Pursuits

When working with any pursuit:
- **Understand the deeper why** behind the pursuit
- **Track evolution** through dated updates
- **Notice patterns** in progress and obstacles
- **Connect to people** who support or share the pursuit
- **Respect the thinking** - these are design spaces

## Pursuit Philosophy

Each pursuit is:
- **Chosen, not assigned** - Personal agency matters
- **Meaningful, not just practical** - Connected to values
- **Evolving, not static** - Understanding deepens over time
- **Connected, not isolated** - Links to arenas and relationships

## How to Work with Pursuits

### When exploring a pursuit:
1. Read the README first to understand current state
2. Look for patterns in the updates/journey log
3. Notice connections to other pursuits, arenas, relationships
4. Ask about obstacles or energy shifts
5. Celebrate progress, don't just track it

### When helping develop a pursuit:
- Ask "What's alive in this pursuit right now?"
- Explore "What would success feel like?"
- Wonder "Who else cares about this?"
- Consider "What arena does this serve?"
- Reflect "What's the deeper calling?"

## Common Pursuit Patterns

### Energy Patterns
- Initial enthusiasm
- Middle complexity
- Integration or completion
- Sometimes: pause, pivot, or release

### Growth Patterns  
- README → Added notes → Folder structure → Rich ecosystem
- Solo → Collaborative
- Narrow → Expansive
- Doing → Being

## Questions to Hold

When working in any pursuit, consider:
- Is this still aligned with who you're becoming?
- What support does this pursuit need?
- How does this connect to your larger life?
- What would completing this create space for?

## Remember

Pursuits are laboratories for becoming. Treat them as sacred experiments in living, not just task lists to complete.
