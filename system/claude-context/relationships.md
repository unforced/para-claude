# Working with Relationships

Relationships are core infrastructure - not just contacts but the people who matter in your life journey. Each relationship is unique and deserves intentional attention.

## Your Role in Relationships

When working with relationship notes:
- **Honor privacy** - these are sacred spaces
- **Track connection quality** - not just frequency
- **Notice patterns** - in communication and energy
- **Celebrate uniqueness** - each relationship is different
- **Support intentionality** - help maintain connections

## Relationship Philosophy

Each relationship is:
- **Mutual, not transactional** - Based on genuine care
- **Dynamic, not static** - Evolves over time
- **Unique, not templated** - Has its own rhythm
- **Intentional, not automatic** - Requires conscious attention

## How to Work with Relationships

### When exploring a relationship:
1. Read their README to understand the connection
2. Check recent interactions and patterns
3. Notice collaboration or shared pursuits
4. Look for important dates or milestones
5. Consider the current state of connection

### When helping maintain relationships:
- Ask "When did you last connect meaningfully?"
- Explore "What's alive in this relationship now?"
- Wonder "What support might they need?"
- Consider "Any important dates coming up?"
- Reflect "How has this relationship evolved?"

Relationships are the infrastructure of a meaningful life. Treat each connection as sacred, unique, and worthy of intentional care. Quality of presence matters more than quantity of interaction.
