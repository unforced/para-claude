# Para-Claude 🧠✨

An intentional life operating system that transforms your Obsidian vault into a thinking partner. Combines the PARA method with Claude Code's intelligence to create a second brain that asks questions, discovers connections, and grows with you.

## What is Para-Claude?

Para-Claude reimagines personal knowledge management as a conversation. Instead of rigid folders and tags, you have:

- **Pursuits** - Meaningful quests you're actively choosing
- **Arenas** - Life spaces where you show up and grow  
- **Relationships** - People as core infrastructure, not afterthoughts
- **Archives** - Completed journeys with wisdom preserved

Every interaction is designed to understand your intent, not just organize your information.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Conversational Commands
```
You: /new-pursuit "Write Novel"

Claude: I'd love to help you set up this pursuit thoughtfully.
        What draws you to writing a novel?
        
        1. Creative expression - stories demanding to be told
        2. Professional goal - establish author career  
        3. Personal challenge - prove I can do it
        4. Legacy - share wisdom/experience
        5. Other: ___
```

### 🔄 Intelligent Daily Processing
```
You: /process-daily

Claude: I found several interesting patterns in today's note:

        🎯 Potential new pursuit:
        "Thinking about starting a podcast" (mentioned 3x this month)
        → Would you like to create [[Pursuits/Podcast Launch]]?

        💫 New connection:
        "Coffee with Amy - great energy about design"
        → Create [[Relationships/Amy Chen]]?
```

### 👥 Relationship Intelligence
```
You: /relationship-check

Claude: 💛 Sarah - Strong connection, regular coffee chats
        ⚠️ Mom - Haven't talked in 2 weeks (usually weekly)
        🎂 John - Birthday next Tuesday!
        
        Would you like suggestions for reconnecting?
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/para-claude.git

# Install in your Obsidian vault
cd para-claude
./install.sh /path/to/your/obsidian/vault

# Start creating
/new-pursuit "Your first meaningful quest"
```

## 📋 Requirements

- **Obsidian** - Your thinking environment
- **Claude Code** - Your AI partner (formerly Cursor)
- **Open Mind** - Ready to think differently about PKM

## 🎯 Philosophy

Traditional PKM focuses on capture and retrieval. Para-Claude focuses on growth and connection.

We believe:
- **Questions > Categories** - Understanding intent matters more than filing
- **People > Productivity** - Relationships are infrastructure
- **Growth > Management** - Your system should evolve with you
- **Meaning > Efficiency** - Choose pursuits that matter
